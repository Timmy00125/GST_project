Create a simple model for me
the model is for a Population health management system i want to be able to do simple predictions 
the model will be trained in google colab write the traiing script of me and write the testing script and also a script for validating the model as well as saving the model the training will be in one colab script i want to be able to predict all/most features on the conditions dataset
the i already have the datset:
patients_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/AI_ML/Population_health/dataset/patients.csv"
conditions_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/AI_ML/Population_health/dataset/conditions.csv"
observations_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/AI_ML/Population_health/dataset/observations.csv

the patients dataset has these columns:
Id	BIRTHDATE	DEATHDATE	SSN	DRIVERS	PASSPORT	PREFIX	FIRST	LAST	SUFFIX	MAIDEN	MARITAL	RACE	ETHNICITY	GENDER	BIRTHPLACE	ADDRESS	CITY	STATE	COUNTY	ZIP	LAT	LON	HEALTHCARE_EXPENSES	HEALTHCARE_COVERAGE		
1d604da9-9a81-4ba9-80c2-de3375d59b40	1989-05-25		999-76-6866	S99984236	X19277260X	Mr.	José Eduardo181	Gómez206			M	white	hispanic	M	Marigot  Saint Andrew Parish  DM	427 Balistreri Way Unit 19	Chicopee	Massachusetts	Hampden County	1013	42.22835382	-72.56295055	271227.08	1334.88	

the conditions dataset has these columns:
START	STOP	PATIENT	ENCOUNTER	CODE	DESCRIPTION
2001-05-01		1d604da9-9a81-4ba9-80c2-de3375d59b40	8f104aa7-4ca9-4473-885a-bba2437df588	40055000	Chronic sinusitis (disorder)

and the observations dataset has these columns:
DATE	PATIENT	ENCOUNTER	CODE	DESCRIPTION	VALUE	UNITS	TYPE
2012-01-23T17:45:28Z	034e9e3b-2def-4559-bb2a-7850888ae060	e88bc3a9-007c-405e-aabc-792a38f4aa2b	8302-2	Body Height	193.3	cm	numeric


the model will be used in a system to analyze other large population data
